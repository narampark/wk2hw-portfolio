# Na Ram Park's Portfolio

## Description
This is my first attempt at creating a portfolio from scratch using html and css. It was made to showcase what I can do and as a portfolio I can show to a potential employer. Through making this portfolio I've learned that I have a lot more to learn about CSS. There were many times I just couldn't get it to do what I wanted it to do.
